=== Version ===
This document applies to version 1.0 of TurboTurtle.

=== Instructions ===
TurboTurtle supports about 100 built-in Logo instructions.  This page is intended to be a reference for the usage of these instructions.

Instructions which have parentheses around their names are parenthesized instructions.  These are special instructions which use a different number of input parameters from their non-parenthesized versions, or contain a variable number of input parameters.  For a parenthesized instruction, like: (SUM 1 2 3 4 5), all of the available parameters within the parentheses are gathered and used as inputs to the instruction.

=== Operand Types ===
* ''number''
** A floating-point numeric value.  Can be either an immediate number (like <code>42</code> or <code>10.3</code>), or a numeric value returned from another instruction, or a numeric value in a variable, or a combination of any of these in a numeric expression (such as 42 * :angle + Heading)
* ''immediate number''
** A numeric value which is given directly in the Logo program, such as <code>1</code> or <code>3.14159</code>
* ''boolean''
** A boolean value.  Can be either an immediate boolean (True or False), or a boolean value returned from another instruction, or a boolean value in a variable, or a comparison expression.  A comparison expression can either compare two numeric values (42 * :angle < 180.0) or two booleans (:LastCond <> Xor :a :b).  Boolean comparisons can only compare for equality or non-equality, while numeric comparisons can also compare for greater-than or less-than.
* ''word''
** A text value.  Can be either an immediate word, or a text value returned from an instruction, or a text value in a variable.
* ''immediate word''
** A word whose value is given directly in the Logo program, such as <code>"This_is_a_word</code>
* ''list''
** An ordered list of numbers.  Can be either an immediate list, or a list returned from an instruction, or the value of a list variable
* ''immediate list''
** A group of immediate numbers separated by spaces and surrounded by brackets, such as: <code>[1 2 3 4.5 67 0.899 -20]</code>
* ''instructionlist''
** A sequence of instructions surrounded by brackets, such as <code>[ Home FD 20 RT 90 ]</code>
* ''array''
** A set of numbers in a 1, 2, or 3 dimensional matrix.  The only functions which can return arrays are ARRAY and MDARRAY, and these 2 functions can only be used as inputs to the MAKE instruction.  All other instructions must use arrays stored in variables.

=== Variable Definition ===
There are two instructions for defining variables: one for global variables and one for local variables.  These instructions do not return any value.

* MAKE '''name''' '''value'''
** <u>Operand types</u>: '''name''' (''immediate word''), '''value''' (''number'' or ''list'' or ''word'' or ''array'' or ''boolean'')
** <u>Usage</u>: This instruction creates a global variable named '''name''' and assigns it a value of '''value'''.

* LOCALMAKE '''name''' '''value'''
** <u>Operand types</u>: '''name''' (''immediate word''), '''value''' (''number'' or ''list'' or ''word'' or ''array'' or ''boolean'')
** <u>Usage</u>: This instruction creates a local variable named '''name''' and assigns it a value of '''value'''.  The LOCALMAKE instruction can only be used inside of a procedure.

=== Control Structures ===
The control instructions handle normal programming constructs like looping, conditional execution, exiting and returning a value from a procedure, and jumping to a different part of the program.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <u>Return Type</u> || <u>Instruction</u> || <u>Abbreviated Name</u> || <u>Operand 1</u> || <u>Operand 2</u> || <u>Usage</u> 
|-
| || REPEAT || || ''number'' '''count''' || ''instructionlist'' '''instructionlist''' || Executes the instructions in '''instructionlist''' in a loop '''count''' times.  If '''count''' is less than 1, '''instructionlist''' will not be executed. 
|-
| || FOREVER || || ''instructionlist'' '''instructionlist''' || || Executes the instructions in '''instructionlist''' continuously. 
|-
| ''number'' || REPCOUNT ||  # || || || Returns the value of the loop counter for the innermost REPEAT or FOREVER instruction.  The counter begins at 1 and increments by 1 at the end of each loop iteration. 
|-
| || FOR || || ''special'' '''forcontrol''' || ''instructionlist'' '''instructionlist''' || This instruction will create a new local variable and execute the instructions in '''instructionlist''', updating the value of the local variable after each iteration, until a condition is met.  The format of '''forcontrol''' can be either <code>[</code>'''varname''' '''start''' '''stop'''<code>]</code> or <code>[</code>'''varname''' '''start''' '''stop''' '''step'''<code>]</code>.  '''varname''' is the name of the local variable which will be created.  '''varname''' is like an ''immediate word'', but without the preceding quotation mark.  '''start''', '''stop''', (and '''limit''' if present) are ''numbers''.  For the 3-parameter variant, first '''varname''' is initialized to the number '''start''', the loop begins and the '''instructionlist''' is executed, then '''varname''' changes in the direction of '''stop''' by 1.0 units.  If the value of '''varname''' has not crossed over '''stop''' and is not equal to '''stop''', another loop iteration begins and '''instructionlist''' is executed again.  The 3-parameter variant guarantees that '''instructionlist''' will be executed at least once and will not be executed more than floor(abs('''stop''' - '''start'''))+1 times.  For the 4-parameter variant, first '''varname''' is initialized to the number '''start''', then the loop begins.  The loop starts by comparing the sign of '''varname'''-'''stop''' to the sign of '''step'''.  If '''varname''' is equal to '''stop''' or the sign of '''varname'''-'''stop''' is different from the sign of '''step''', then the '''instructionlist''' is executed, '''step''' is added to '''varname''', and the loop begins again.  Otherwise the loop ends.  It is possible to construct a 4-parameter FOR loop which will not execute the '''instructionlist''' at all, such as FOR <code>[ i 0 2 -1 ]</code> 
|-
| || DO.WHILE || || ''instructionlist'' '''instructionlist''' || ''boolean'' '''tf''' || This instruction repeatedly executes '''instructionlist''' and then tests value of the expression '''tf''', until the value of '''tf''' is False.  For example, if '''tf''' is the ''immediate boolean'' False, the '''instructionlist''' will only execute once.  However, if '''tf''' is the ''immediate boolean'' True, it will execute repeatedly forever. 
|-
| || WHILE || || ''boolean'' '''tf''' || ''instructionlist'' '''instructionlist''' || This instruction repeatedly tests the value of the expression '''tf''', breaks out of the loop if the value of '''tf''' is False, otherwise executes '''instructionlist''' and begins the loop again.  If '''tf''' is the ''immediate boolean'' False, the '''instructionlist''' will not execute at all.  However, if '''tf''' is the ''immediate boolean'' True, it will execute repeatedly forever. 
|-
| || DO.UNTIL || || ''instructionlist'' '''instructionlist''' || ''boolean'' '''tf''' || This instruction repeatedly executes '''instructionlist''' and then tests value of the expression '''tf''', until the value of '''tf''' is True.  For example, if '''tf''' is the ''immediate boolean'' False, the '''instructionlist''' will execute repeatedly forever.  However, if '''tf''' is the ''immediate boolean'' True, it will only execute once. 
|-
| || UNTIL || || ''boolean'' '''tf''' || ''instructionlist'' '''instructionlist''' || This instruction repeatedly tests the value of the expression '''tf''', breaks out of the loop if the value of '''tf''' is True, otherwise executes '''instructionlist''' and begins the loop again.  If '''tf''' is the ''immediate boolean'' False, the '''instructionlist''' will execute repeatedly forever.  However, if '''tf''' is the ''immediate boolean'' True, it will not execute at all.

| <u>Instruction</u> || <u>Abbreviated Name</u> || <u>Operand 1</u> || <u>Usage</u> 
|-
| STOP || || || The STOP instruction returns from a procedure and resumes execution at the next instruction after the procedure call.  The STOP instruction does not return any value.  The STOP instruction can only be used from within a user-defined procedure.  A procedure cannot contain both STOP and OUTPUT instructions. 
|-
| OUTPUT || OP || ''number'' or ''list'' or ''word'' or ''boolean'' '''value''' || The OUTPUT instruction exits from a user-defined procedure and returns '''value''' in the place where the procedure was called.  The OUTPUT instruction can only be used from within a user-defined procedure.  A procedure cannot contain both STOP and OUTPUT instructions, and all OUTPUT instructions in a user-defined procedure must return the same type. 
|-
| WAIT || || ''number'' '''time''' || This instruction pauses for a specified amount of time.  The amount of time for which the program execution is paused is equal to '''time'''/60 seconds.  For example, "WAIT 60.0" will pause for exactly 1 second. 
|-
| GOTO || || ''immediate word'' '''label''' || The GOTO instruction causes the execution path of the program to jump to the instruction TAG with the same label as '''label'''. 
|-
| TAG || || ''immediate word'' '''label''' || The TAG instruction denotes the place in the program to where a GOTO instruction with the same '''label''' will jump.

An '''index''' value of 0 or less will cause the text to be drawn below the turtle position.  An '''index''' value of exactly 1 will cause the text to be drawn vertically centered over the turtle position.  And '''index''' value of 2 or more will cause the text to be drawn above the turtle position. 
|-
| SETJUSTIFYHORZ || || ''number'' '''index''' || || Sets the current horizontal justification type used by the LABEL instruction.  An '''index''' value of 0 or less will cause the text to be drawn to the right of the turtle position.  An '''index''' value of exactly 1 will cause the text to be drawn horizontally centered over the turtle position.  And '''index''' value of 2 or more will cause the text to be drawn to the left of the turtle position. 
|-
| SETPOS || || ''list'' '''pos''' || || Sets the current turtle position to the X,Y location given by the first 2 elements of the list '''pos'''. This draws a line if the pen is down.

=== Turtle and Window Control ===
These are control instructions for the turtle and display window.  These instructions do not take any operands or return any value.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <u>Instruction</u> || <u>Abbreviated Name</u> || <u>Usage</u> 
|-
| CLEAN || || Displays everything drawn since the last CLEAN, CLEARSCREEN, or ERASESCREEN instruction and erases the drawing surface.  This instruction does not move the turtle. 
|-
| CLEARSCREEN || CS || Performs exactly the same actions as calling both HOME and CLEAN. 
|-
| ERASESCREEN || || Erases everything on the drawing surface without displaying any previously drawn lines or dots on the screen. 
|-
| HOME || || Moves the turtle to position (0,0) and sets the heading to 0 degrees. 
|-
| WRAP || || Sets the current screen wrapping mode to WRAP. In this mode, when the turtle moves past any of the 4 display boundaries (top, bottom, left, or right), it is transported to the opposite boundary and continues moving.  Using either the WRAP or WINDOW instructions in a TurboTurtle program will cause a performance penalty. 
|-
| WINDOW || || Sets the current screen wrapping mode to WINDOW.  In this mode, when the turtle moves past any of the 4 display boundaries, the lines drawn are no longer visible on the screen until the turtle comes back within the display boundaries.  This is the default mode for TurboTurtle programs.  Using either the WRAP or WINDOW instructions in a TurboTurtle program will cause a performance penalty. 
|}
